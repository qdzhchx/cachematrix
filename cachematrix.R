## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do
#The functions below can cache the inverse of a matrix. 
#By doing this, the inverse can be looked up in the cache rather than recomputed when we need it again.

## Write a short comment describing this function
#The first function, makeCacheMatrix creates a special "vector", which is really a list containing a function to
#1.set the value of the matrix
#2.get the value of the matrix
#3.set the value of the inverse
#4.get the value of the inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        i <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                i <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setinverse <- function(inverse) i <<- inverse
        getinverse <- function() i
        list(set = set, get = get,
             setinverse = setinverse,
             getinverse = getinverse)

}


## Write a short comment describing this function
#The following function calculates the inverse of the special "vector" created with the above function. 
#However, it first checks to see if the inverse has already been calculated. 
#If so, it gets the inverse from the cache and skips the computation. 
#Otherwise, it calculates the inverse of the matrix and sets the value of the inverse in the cache via the setinverse function.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
        i <- x$getinverse()
        if(!is.null(i)) {
                message("getting cached data")
